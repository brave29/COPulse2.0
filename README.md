## CoPulse Application

### Overview

A web application in the works that uses machine learning algorithm and digital twins to predict heart disease. A simple web application which uses Machine Learning algorithm and digital twin to predict the heart disease using person's characterics such as gender, blood pressure, cholestrol, heart rate, etc. To make it more exciting, fitbit API is introduced to demonstrate the fitbit API integration to obtain real time heart rate information.

### Project Structure

- Project consist `app.py` script which is used to run the application and is engine of this app. contians API that gets input from the user and computes a predicted value based on the model.
- `pulse-intelligence.py` code to build and train the AI model using kaggle dataset - processed_cleveland.csv
- fitbitapi.py - code to integrate with Fitbit API
- main.py - primary business logic code to derive the prediction based on heart rate and other input information
- /templates - contains main.html and result.html - first used to gather input and second used to display the results. Both are connected via the Flask python calls.
- /static folder contains file `style.css` which adds some styling and enhance the look of the application. 

### Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.8. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Run 

*To Run the Application*

```
python main.py
```
